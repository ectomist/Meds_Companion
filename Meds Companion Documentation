Meds Companion Documentation

So this project is all about creating awareness to the ordinary people about medicine that they consume.

First of all this is a very small project but there are lot of new technology and new approaches taken to build this project

The main attraction of this project is using a new way of making android application which is Jetpack compass that has been in the market for around 2 years but it has become recently stable

Reason for using Jetpack compose is it eliminates a lot of boilerplate code reduces the need of XML code which has very complicated and confusing and which makes the project much messier

Project Details
Things that are present in this project 

Routing and navigation is one of the most important part of an application and this part is used in this app when the app is switched from splash cream or the first screen to the second screen

The usage of asynchronous programming is also used in this project in the form of routine and navigation that is present on the flash screen

The architecture of this app is MVVM which stands for model view view model which makes the app a little bit complicated to structure but it is much more scalable and the main focus of this project is not to build but to make it very much future proof and understanding the architecture which is a very important part in software engineering

Show the app is very well focused on the UI and integrating that UI to the system for this to achieve this app needed to be dynamic to the operating system condition that changes

Many new technology's and new methods were used here to make the app very dynamic and responsive to the system like when user switches from dark mode to light mode the app will respond according to the operating system itself and there are many things such as dynamic icons adaptive icons which are present in Android 13 or API level 33 are present in this app
